I studied Political Science as an undergraduate.I was surprised to find my reserch methods courses very engaging, <br>I always found statitics the most approachable form of math. As a student, I was fascinated by the capacity of statistical data to tell a story or warp a narrative. <br>I also found the (limited) coding we practecd very engaging and realized I wanted to learn more. <br> That's how I ended up at coding temple!<br><br> If you can't tell from the heading at the top of this page, I'm a big fan of Star Trek.
