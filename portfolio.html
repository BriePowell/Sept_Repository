            My name is Brie, I'm a 
            I studied Political Science as an undergraduate. 
            I was surprised to find my reserch methods courses very engaging, <br>I always found statitics the most approachable form of math. 
            As a student, I was fascinated by the capacity of statistical data to tell a story or warp a narrative. <br>
            I also found the (limited) coding we practecd very engaging and realized I wanted to learn more. <br>
            That's how I ended up at coding temple!<br><br>

            If you can't tell from the reference at the top, I'm a big fan of Star Trek.
